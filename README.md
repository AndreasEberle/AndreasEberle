Hi , my name is Andreas Kafkis-Eberle.
My main interests are web development along with vanilla Java programming.
Hobby-wise I like learning foreign languages , currently aiming for N1 in Japanese.

I'm really looking forward to meeting new people especially from different countries & cultures.

And lest we forget , I love travelling! :smiley:
